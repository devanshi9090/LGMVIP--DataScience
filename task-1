The aim of the project was to classify the species based on their attributes

The data set given was the iris dataset, it contains columns like - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, species name

The aim was to use certain models/algorithms to classify the species on the basis of their attributes,

Thus, to predict the type of the speices on the basis of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width

the predictions made are stored in a new variable y_pred

INITIATION
* Importing various important libraries for loading the data, data visualisations, making predictions, model selection, etc

* Reading the file

* Data pre-processing, checking the info, descriptions, null - values, etc

* Data - visualisations, to better understand the data and extract the essential informations

* Splitting the entire dataset into 2 parts - x - which is the independent variable and y - which is the independent one.

*Now, we further need to split x and y into x_test, x_train and y_test and y_train

*Our aim is to feed the model with x_test as an input and the model should predict the types of the species on the basis of input x_test

*We import Logistic Regression to perform this type of classification

*Since the values will be classified into any 1 of the 3 total species values.

then , later, we check the accuracy and draw the confusion matrix
